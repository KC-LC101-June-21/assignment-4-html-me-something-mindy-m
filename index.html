               It all started with a little group called <a href="https://mlh.io/">MLH</a>.

               It's from them that I discovered the joy of a huggable, sharky friend from Ikea.  Needless to say, one was soon on the way.

               I was excited to see my new arrival!  I thought it odd that there was so much space in the box, but I figured they just didn't want to squish him.

            <p>
               Blahaj was finally home.

               You can guess which one was my favorite.
